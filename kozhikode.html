        <h2>KOZHIKODE</h2>
       <p style="text-align: justify;">Kozhikode or Calicut district, in the central part of the former Malabar district, is a district of Kerala state, on the southwest coast of India. The city of Kozhikode, also known as Calicut, is the district headquarters. The district is 38.25% urbanised. Kozhikode district is bordered by the districts of Kannur and Mahé (Puducherry) to the north, Wayanad to the east, and Malappuram to the south. The Arabian Sea lies to the west and Western Ghats stretches towards east. Vavul Mala is the highest peak in the district. It lies between latitudes 11° 08'N and 11° 50'N and longitudes 75° 30'E and 76° 8'E.The district is divided into four taluks: Kozhikode, Vatakara, Koyilandy and Thamarassery. By the 2011 census there are 12 block panchayats: Balusseri, Chelannur, Koduvally, Kozhikode, Kunnamangalam, Kunnummal, Melady, Panthalayani, Perambra, Thodannur, Thuneri and Vatakara. Kozhikode was the Capital of Malabar during the Zamorin rule 500 years ago and is famous for its centuries-old trade in cotton and spices with Jews, Arabs, Phoenicians and Chinese. Basking in the idyllic setting of the serene Arabian Sea on the west and the proud peaks of the Wayanad hills on the east, this district with the serene beaches, lush green countryside, historic sites, all combine to make Kozhikode a popular tourist destination.Vasco da Gama had set his foot on the remote beach of Kappad in Kozhikode in 1498 and 'Discovered India' and established spice trade routes with the west. Kozhikode city is the marketing centre for commodities like pepper coconut, coffee, rubber, lemongrass oil etc., produced in Kozhikode and the neighbouring districts of Wayanad, Malappuram and Kannur.  Being the major trade centre in Malabar and major exporter to foreign countries, the international travellers christened this district as ‘the noble emporium of India’. Being a potpourri of many traditions such as Arabic and Chinese, Calicut enjoys an exceptionally outstanding culinary culture. The city is best associated with Kozhikodan Halwa (a flour-based confectionery which comes in many flavours) and no traveller should miss tasting this heavenly delight. Another food that made Calicut famous around the globe is its Malabar Biriyani which is served in almost all the restaurants of the district. Sea foods, pathiri, banana chips and ghee rice are some other delights no traveller would want to miss. Calicut will serve as a true paradise for those who want to explore the place on foot. The churches, temples, streets and monuments of this district invite travellers with their hues and histories. Beypore and Kappad Beach lure the visitors with scenic beauty and coastal merriment. Kadalundi Bird Sanctuary will kindle the interest of birdwatchers, it being home to a wide variety of bird species. Thusharagiri Waterfalls and Peruvannamuzhi Dam are perfect spots for family picnics and one day trips. Another must-see attraction of Calicut is the Mithai Theruvu (more popularly known as SM Street) which is a chief commercial centre of the city and an ideal place to go shopping. Other popular attractions of Calicut include Thikkoti Lighthouse, Manachira Square, Pazhassiraja Museum, Kalipoyika, Lion's Park, Tali Temple, Kakkayam, Krishna Menon Museum and planetarium.
