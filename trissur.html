Spanning an area of about 3,032 km2 (1,171 sq mi), Thrissur district is home to over 9% of Kerala's population.Thrissur district is bordered by the districts of Palakkad and Malappuram to the north, and the districts of Ernakulam and Idukki to the south and Coimbatore district to the east.The Arabian Sea lies to the west and Western Ghats stretches towards the east.Thrissur district was formed on 1 July 1949, with the headquarters at Thrissur City. Thrissur is known as the cultural capital of Kerala, and the land of Poorams. The district is known for its ancient temples, churches, and mosques. Thrissur Pooram is the most colourful temple festival in Kerala.The name Thrissur (Thrishiva Perur) is derived from 'Thiru-Shiva-Perur' (Tamil), which translates to "The city with the name of the Lord Siva". Thrissur was also known as "Vrishabhadripuram" and "Then Kailasam" (Tamil) (Kailasam of the south) in ancient days.[citation needed] Another interpretation is 'Tri-shiva-peroor' or the big land with three Shiva temples, which refers to the three places where Lord Shiva resides – namely Vadakkunnathan temple, Asokeswaram Siva temple and Irattachira Siva temple. History of Thrissur dates back to Stone Age. Archaeological sites and monuments speak of its role in the history of Kerala and India. Its role in world trade dates back to first century AD. It was the hub through which the spices of the East reached the West. From ancient times, this district with its cultural heritage and archaeological wealth has played a significant role in the political history of South India. Many rulers and dynasties beginning with the Zamorins of Kozhikode, Tipu Sultan of Mysore and Europeans including the Dutch and the British have had a hand in molding the destiny of this region.Thrissur is a cross section of Kerala in its essence.
