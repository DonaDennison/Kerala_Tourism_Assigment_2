        <h2>PALAKKAD</h2>
        <P style="text-align: justify;">Palakkad District, in the southeastern part of the former Malabar district, is one of the 14 districts of the South Indian state of Kerala. Also, it is the largest district in Kerala from 2006. The city of Palakkad is the district headquarters.
           Palakkad is bordered on the northwest by the Malappuram District, on the southwest by the Thrissur District, on the northeast by The Nilgiris District, and on the east by Coimbatore district of Tamil Nadu. The district is 24.4% urbanized according to the census of 2011.The district is nicknamed "the granary of Kerala".Palakkad is the gateway to Kerala due to the presence of the Palakkad Gap, in the Western Ghats. The total area of the district is 4,480 km2 (1,730 sq mi) which is 11.5% of the state's area which makes it the largest district of Kerala. Out of the total area of 4,480 km2 (1,730 sq mi), about 1,360 km2 (530 sq mi) of land is covered by forests. Most parts of the district fall in the midland region (elevation 75–250 m or 246–820 ft), except the Nelliampathy-Parambikulam area in the Chittur taluk in the south and Attappadi-Malampuzha area in the north, which are hilly and fall in the highland region (elevation > 250 m or 820 ft).The climate is pleasant for most parts of the year, the exception is the summer months. There is sufficient rainfall and it receives more rainfall than the extreme southern districts of Kerala. The district is blessed with many small and medium rivers, which are tributaries of the Bharathapuzha River. A number of dams have been built across these rivers, the largest being the Malampuzha dam. The largest in volume capacity is the Parambikulam Dam. Palaghat Gap, a natural pass located along the Western Ghats, makes Palakkad a strategic gateway connecting Kerala with its neighboring state of Tamil Nadu. Unlike the other districts of Kerala, Palakkad has a Tamil speaking population which contributed to the emergence of a unique culture in the region. The proximity of Tamil Nadu has given rise to a distinctive food culture that thrives predominantly on traditional Kerala and Tamil flavors. Two key features that have attributed uniqueness to the cultural history of Palakkad are its temple festivals and a well-preserved tradition of Karnatic music. Being the birthplace of Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavathar and Palakkad Mani Iyer, two renowned musicians of Karnatic tradition, Palakkad has grabbed the attention from music lovers from across the country.Palakkad is credited with a good number of sightseeing options including forts, temples, dams, wildlife sanctuaries, waterfalls, parks and picturesque landscapes. Palakkad Fort and Jain Temple are of significant historical interest and draws travellers throughout the year. Malampuzha dam and gardens, along with the amusement park situated in the area, serve as an excellent picnic spot. Nelliampathi Hill Station, Silent Valley National Park and Parambikkulam Wildlife Sanctuary offer nature lovers and wildlife enthusiasts with a delightful holidaying experience. Kanjirapuzha, Dhoni Waterfalls, Ottapalam, Kollengode Palace and Thenkurussi are other prominent destinations that demand a visit. Palakkad enjoys good connectivity by rail and road and the climate of the region is pleasant throughout the year except for the summers. The rare amalgam of traditions, scenic stretches of landscapes, exceptional sightseeing options and the hues of festivities make Palakkad a much sought-after travel destination in South India.
