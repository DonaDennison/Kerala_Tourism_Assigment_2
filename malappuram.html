        <h2>MALAPPURAM</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Malappuram (also Malapuram)is a city in the Indian state of Kerala, spread over an area of 58.20 km2 (22.47 sq mi). The first municipality in the district formed in 1969, Malappuram serves as the administrative headquarters of Malappuram district. Divided into 40 electoral wards, the city has a population density of 1,742 per square kilometre (4,510 per square mile). Malappuram is a northern district in Kerala known for its rich culture, historic significance and remarkable heritage. Malappuram is situated in the mid land area of the state. As the name suggests, it is covered with small mountains of lush greenery, bonded with several freshwater streams flowing through the city. Kadalundi Puzha, a major river in Kerala is flowing around the city. Malappuram is one of the few municipalities in the state with a tremendous track record of keeping the city clean. The region of Malappuram, speckled with small hills and mounds, justifies its name which in Malayalam means ‘Hill Top’. With a history that weaves ancient and modern times together, the region contributed extensively to the culture, religion, economy as well as tourism of Kerala. The district invited the attention of economists from all over the country in recent times due to its Gulf migrant population which gave rise to an unprecedented economic boom. Three rivers, namely Chaliyar, Bharathapuzha and Kadalundi, flow through the land of Malappuram enriching both its soil and its culture. The powerful army of the Zamorins kings of Calicut was headquartered here in the olden days. The name of the district is marked in the history of Indian nationalism for being the venue for Khilafat Movement and Mopila Revolt. Malappuram is the birth place of the Muslim dance form, Oppana. The small towns of Malappuram contributed to the cultural, political, literary traditions of Kerala in matchless manners. Thirunavaya was a hub for Vedic education during medieval times and from Kottakkal originated traditional medical system of Ayurveda. Ponnani (an ancient center of Islamic learning) and Nilambur (better known as the teak town of the country) have given global acclamation to Malappuram. The sightseeing options in Malappuram include Kadalundi Bird Sanctuary, Keraladeshpuram Temple and Thirunavaya Temple. The region houses a number of other temples and mosques such as Malappuram Juma Masjid, Mannoor Shiva Temple, Thiruppuranthaka Temple and Vettakorumakan Temple. The hill garden at Kottakkunnu, Biyyam Lake and the riverside park of Shanthitheeram draw thousands with their potential for tourism. Malappuram enjoys good connectivity by road, rail and air enabling travellers to visit the place around the year. The climate of the region is moderate and suitable for sightseeing. The dominance of Muslim population has given rise to a spectacular food culture in the district which combines Arabic and traditional Kerala flavors.
